## Technical test

> [View the repo on Github](https://github.com/rolandjlevy/collective-london-task)

### Installation and set up
+ Clone this repo
+ Run `npm install` to install dependencies
+ Run `npm run dev` to create a development build with webpack
+ Open http://localhost:9000/ in the browser

### Technology
+ Random user API
+ Vanilla JavaScript
+ Sass, BEM
+ Webpack, Babel
+ Git

### Process
+ Set up development environment: Webpack, Babel, node modules
+ Created structure and basic layout with HTML and Sass, based on wireframe and task brief
+ Read [Random User API](https://randomuser.me) documentation to understand scope and limitations
+ Created functionality for pulling user data from API, based on menu selection or search query
+ Enabled responsiveness for mobile and desktop views
+ Used Sass to style the UI
+ Prepared for deployment, wrote comments in JS files and created readme file

### Build and deployment
+ Used Webpack to bundle JS files, Sass files and images
+ Used Babel to transpile JS code
+ App folder is for development and dist folder is for deployment
+ Please see comments in webpack.config.js for a general explanation of the build process

### Compatibility and standards compliance
+ Audit reports for mobile and desktop views have been generated using Lighthouse and are in the root directory. See the reports by loading them into [Lighthouse report viewer](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/)
+ Animations are cross-browser compatible
+ The app was tested in Chrome and Safari 
+ The API would't run in Firefox due to this error: [CORS request did not succeed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSDidNotSucceed)

### Challenges and areas for improvement
+ The main challenge was creating the responsiveness without Flexbox or Grid. It was a good opportunity to improve my CSS skills.
+ I would have liked to have gone deeper into Sass and  explored features like Saas functions, mixins and loops.
+ The user experience could have been better on the mobile view. Loading the users' details into the info area below the list of users feels a bit clunky
+ I encountered bugs when trying to animate the closing of the sidebar in CSS.
+ Creating this app with a UI library like React would mean better readability, easier maintainability and taking advantage of components which maximizes reusability and optimises the architecture.
